# We're Moving!

We're in the process of moving issue tracking from this issues-only repo over to our main Service Fabric repo where the project code lives at https://github.com/Microsoft/service-fabric.

## Where to open a new issue

**Issues should be opened in one of the feature repos:**

| Component   | Repo |
| ----------- | ---- |
| Core platform and runtime | [service-fabric](https://github.com/Microsoft/service-fabric)
| Reliable Services and Reliable Actors      |  [service-fabric-services-and-actors-dotnet](https://github.com/Microsoft/service-fabric-services-and-actors-dotnet)       |
| ASP.NET Core on Service Fabric     |  [service-fabric-aspnetcore](https://github.com/Microsoft/service-fabric-aspnetcore)       |
| Service Fabric CLI      |  [service-fabric-cli](https://github.com/Microsoft/service-fabric-cli)       |
| Service Fabric Explorer      |  [service-fabric-services-and-actors-dotnet](https://github.com/Microsoft/service-fabric-explorer)       |



## General how-to and documentation issues

We are also actively monitoring the following forums and recommend that you use them as described below:

### StackOverflow

The [Service Fabric tag on StackOverflow][stackoverflow-tag] is the best place for questions about how the platform works and how you might accomplish certain tasks with it.

### Microsoft Docs conceptual documentation

The comment threads on the [Service Fabric conceptual documentation][acom-docs] are the right place to report errors in the documentation itself or to report issues that occurred while following along with a given article. If the issue you're encountering turns out to be a product bug, we will transfer it to the issues list in this repo and link to it in the Disqus thread.

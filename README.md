## General how-to and documentation issues

We are also actively monitoring the following forums and recommend that you use them as described below:

### StackOverflow

The [Service Fabric tag on StackOverflow][http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/azure-service-fabric] is the best place for questions about how the platform works and how you might accomplish certain tasks with it.

### Microsoft Docs conceptual documentation
